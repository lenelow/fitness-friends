## Description

This is the front-end server for our Fitness Friends App we built for General Assembly's WDI group project.  This was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). For details about the back end, please visit [https://github.com/MarissaWood/fitness-friends-api](https://github.com/MarissaWood/fitness-friends-api).  

Fitness Friends is a social network app for finding friends to work out with or for coordinating workout schedules amongst friends.  

## Features

Users can create profiles to display their workout preferences and activities schedule.

Users can view workout activities from their friends and join them in real life.

## Installation Instructions / Deployed Version:

To install and run locally, you need to make sure you have the back end server up and running.  You can find details [here](https://github.com/MarissaWood/fitness-friends-api).  Once that is ready to go, follow the steps below:

## Future Directions & Unsolved Problems

In the future we would like to implement a calendar view for the activities of each user and of their friend's activities.  

Another goal is to integrate with third party API's for fitness class schedules so it would be a one-stop shop for users trying to find a workout or workout buddy.
